The waterfall stands at about **60 meters (197 feet)**, cascading through lush greenery and rocks, offering a peaceful and picturesque sight.\n\n*   The falls are not as easily accessible as some other waterfalls in Sri Lanka. Visitors typically need to hike to reach the base of the waterfall, making it a more adventurous destination for those who enjoy trekking.\n\n*   Surrounded by tea plantations, mist-covered hills, and dense forests, Gartmore Falls offers a serene and untouched natural environment, perfect for photography and nature walks.\n\n*   The waterfall is at its most impressive during the rainy season when the water flow is at its peak. However, visiting during the dry season (December to April) is also an option for a more accessible hike.\n\n*   Reaching Gartmore Falls requires a short but enjoyable hike, providing stunning views of the surrounding landscapes. The trek is relatively easy and is perfect for nature lovers.\n\n**Gartmore Falls** in **Maskeliya** is a hidden gem for those who want to experience Sri Lankaâ€™s natural beauty and enjoy a quiet, serene atmosphere far from the typical tourist crowds.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
