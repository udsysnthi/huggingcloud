          Lovely people, excellent food, and clean accommodation very close to
          Adam’s Peak. Gave us lots of advice on our hike. Great to come back
          and shower and have a yummy breakfast after the beautiful hike. Highly
          recommend for anyone looking for accommodation or even just a meal in
          this area.

          This is the perfect place to stay to hike Adam’s Peak AND explore
          Nallathanniya. Do yourself a favor and book at LEAST two nights. We
          rearranged our plans to stay a second night after hiking Adam’s Peak
          and one of the owners took us on the most epic and beautiful tour of
          the tea plantations and waterfalls in the area. A highlight of our
          trip and views that rival the train ride to Ella. You can see their
          reviews for tours by searching Hugging Clouds Tours. Food was
          excellent, especially the Lumprais. Breakfast stellar. Staff amazing.
          They went above and beyond to help us with a train ticket issue as
          well. Amazing customer service. We were sad to leave, but look forward
          to coming back.

          I would say it was one of my favorite places to stay in Sri Lanka in
          terms of everything. We went to Nallathanniya to go to Adam's Peek so
          we weren't expecting much but the owners and the place exceeded our
          expectations. The place is old and looks like it's not finished yet
          but it was really clean and enough for us. They helped us with
          lighting for the night hike and prepared our breakfast (Sandwiches) in
          advance for the summit. The sandwiches were really tasty and fresh. We
          didn't want to search for food on Google in the evening so we tried it
          from the hotel and it was great. I would definitely recommend eating
          here instead of eating out. Their food is fresh and delicious.

          Amazing place, simple, cool rooms and great food. we stayed for 2
          nights which I would absolutely recommend.

          Started our hike at 330am and made it to the peak for sunrise to get a
          spot (hugging clouds is 500m) from the start of the trail.

          After the climb we came back and had the best banana pancake for
          breakfast. Lump rice for dinner was also great.

          Hugging clouds organised a TikTok for us to visit moray falls. We
          walked through the tea plantations and swam and had the spot to
          ourselves.

          The 500m proximity to Adam’s peak made it the perfect start point for
          the trek up.

          What really made our stay at Hugging Clouds was the service. Madu took
          us on a waterfall trekking tour. We drove through a tea plantation
          estate and Madu answered all of our questions about tea harvesting and
          manufacturing. We walked through tea crops and across another
          waterfall to get to the top of Gartmore falls for a swim. It was such
          a great day because of his hospitality.

          Would highly recommend staying at Hugging Clouds and going on the
          waterfall tour with Madu!
