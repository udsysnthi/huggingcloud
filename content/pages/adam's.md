          Adam's Peak (also known as **Sri Pada**) is a significant mountain
          located in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. Standing at 2,243
          meters (7,359 feet) above sea level, it is one of the most famous
          pilgrimage sites in the country, known for the **"sacred footprint"**
          at its summit. The footprint, which is believed to be the mark of
          Buddha by Buddhists, the mark of Shiva by Hindus, and the mark of Adam
          by Christians and Muslims, is the focal point of spiritual
          significance for people of various religions.


          The mountain has been a **pilgrimage destination** for over a
          millennium, with its significance continuing to this day. People of
          various faiths undertake the strenuous climb to the summit, often as
          an act of devotion and reverence. The pilgrimage season usually runs
          from **December to May** and coincides with favorable weather, with
          the **full moon poya day** (a Buddhist religious day) being especially
          significant for many.


          The **Sri Pada pilgrimage route** is marked by a series of **over
          5,500 steps**, many of which were built by Sri Lankan kings. The climb
          is not just a physical journey but also a **spiritual one**, with
          pilgrims stopping at several shrines along the way for prayer and
          reflection.

          **Adam's Peak (Sri Pada)** holds immense **historical and cultural
          significance** in Sri Lanka, attracting not only local pilgrims but
          also international visitors interested in its deep spiritual heritage.
          The mountain has been revered for over a thousand years by people of
          different faiths, and its cultural importance is interwoven with
          religious beliefs, legends, and historical events.


          ### **Sacred Footprint â€“ A Symbol of Religious Unity**


          The **"sacred footprint"** at the summit of Adam's Peak is central to
          its cultural and religious significance. The footprint is a natural
          rock formation that is believed to have been created by divine
          intervention. Different religious traditions attribute the footprint
          to:


          *   **Buddhism**: Buddhists believe the footprint is that of **Lord
          Buddha**. According to legend, Buddha visited Sri Lanka in ancient
          times, and the footprint is said to mark the place where he stood
          during his visit. It symbolizes his sacred presence in the island and
          is one of the most revered sites in Sri Lankan Buddhism.


          *   **Hinduism**: Hindus believe the footprint is that of **Lord
          Shiva**, who is said to have left the mark when he visited the island.
          The mountain is known as **Shivanolipada** in Tamil, which translates
          to "the place of Shiva's footprint." Some Hindu legends also associate
          the mountain with the story of **King Ravana** from the epic Ramayana.


          *   **Christianity & Islam**: Christian and Muslim traditions also
          have their own interpretations of the sacred footprint. Some Christian
          accounts claim it is the footprint of **Adam**, the first man, who is
          believed to have stood at the summit after being banished from the
          Garden of Eden. Muslims similarly view the footprint as that of
          **Adam** (Hawwa in Islamic tradition), who is thought to have traveled
          to the mountain after his fall from paradise.
