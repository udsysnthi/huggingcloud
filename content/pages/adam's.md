          Adam's Peak (also known as **Sri Pada**) is a significant mountain
          located in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. Standing at 2,243
          meters (7,359 feet) above sea level, it is one of the most famous
          pilgrimage sites in the country, known for the **"sacred footprint"**
          at its summit. The footprint, which is believed to be the mark of
          Buddha by Buddhists, the mark of Shiva by Hindus, and the mark of Adam
          by Christians and Muslims, is the focal point of spiritual
          significance for people of various religions.
